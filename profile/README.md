## ⚠️ Risk Level? Moderate–High

Wallhacks are harder to detect than speed or fly hacks, but still *not invisible* to anti-cheat. You’re safer than most cheaters, but still in the red zone. Using this for too long on your main bean could lead to:

* **Account ban**
* **Shadow lobby isolation**
* **EAC flagging**

Play smart: use on alts, rotate hacks, and don’t go full-blast in front of 59 other players.
